### UX999Pro Firmware 2022-03-18

## How to upgrade the firmware of the box without seeing the display screen and inoperable:

Obtain the firmware upgrade package named ""APM888.zip"".

Please prepare a TF card, and put ""APM888.zip"" directly into the TF card (directly placed in the root directory, no need to create any folder, and no need to unzip this file). The TF card used for upgrade does not need to be a blank card, and it does not need to only hold upgrade files, that is, the TF card you use every day can be used as an upgrade card.
You can use the CarPlay USB port on the car to power up the box, or you can use a mobile phone charger with 5V/2A DC output from the USB port to power up the box.

After the box is powered on, please wait for **2 minutes** to ensure that the **red power indicator** on the box is always **on**, and the **blue working status indicator flashes once every second**.

At this point, please insert the upgrade TF card, about **2 minutes**, when the **blue LED is always on** and the **red LED is flashing**, you can pull out the upgrade card.

Wait another **3 minutes** or so, when the r**ed LED is always on** and the **blue LED flashes once every second**, the upgrade process is complete.

The entire upgrade process takes about **5 minutes**.

Note: It is better not to cut off the power during the upgrade process, and do not pull out the TF card during the process of copying the upgrade files to the internal memory. Of course, if the above situation occurs, ApplePie will not be damaged because of it, and it will work normally after restarting. It's just that your upgrade process has been canceled this time, and the normal upgrade cannot be completed."
